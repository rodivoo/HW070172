  abstract: '{This article analyzes the extremely severe famine of the 1590s in northern
    Italy, triggered by several consecutive years of bad weather at a time of particularly
    acute population pressure on the available resources. Their failure fuelled a
    general \guillemotleft{} system shock \guillemotright{} for the social, economic
    and demographic structures of Northern Italy, leading to protest, violence and
    general social and economic disorder. The article recurs to a large database of
    demographic time series to identify the areas struck worst by the famine. It then
    focuses on the region Emilia-Romagna, and lastly provides a case study of the
    rural town of Nonantola, for which rare data about age at death during the famine
    are used. The article suggests that the 1590s famine was not solely the result
    of the combination of climate, agrarian technology and demographic density, but
    was a complex \guillemotleft{} human failure \guillemotright{} than can be fully
    understood only by taking into account also institutions, culture, social and
    economic behaviour, and even psychological factors. Cet article analyse la grande

  abstract: '{Existing studies find little connection between living standards and
    mortality in England, but go back only to the sixteenth century. Using new data
    on inheritances, we extend estimates of mortality back to the mid-thirteenth century
    and find, by contrast, that deaths from unfree tenants to the nobility were strongly
    affected by living standards. Looking at a large sample of parishes after 1540,
    we find that the positive check had weakened considerably by 1650 even though
    living standards were static at best, but persisted in London for another century
    despite its higher wages. In both cases the disappearance of the positive check
    coincided with the introduction of systematic poor relief, suggesting that government
    action may have played a role in breaking the link between harvest failure and
    mass mortality.}'

  abstract: '{Many explanations have been offered for the British Industrial Revolution.
    This article points to the importance of human capital (broadly defined) and the
    quality of the British labor force on the eve of the Industrial Revolution. It
    shows that in terms of both physical quality and mechanical skills, British workers
    around 1750 were at a much higher level than their continental counterparts. As
    a result, new inventions\textemdash no matter where they originated\textemdash
    were adopted earlier, faster, and on a larger scale in Britain than elsewhere.
    The gap in labor quality is consistent with the higher wages paid in eighteenth-century
    Britain. The causes for the higher labor quality are explored and found to be
    associated with a higher level of nutrition and better institutions, especially
    England''s Poor Law and the superior functioning of its apprenticeship system.}'

    The antitrust regime put in place in the early twentieth century managed this
    balancing act by focusing on large firms'' conduct toward competitors and banning
    practices that were anticompetitive or exclusionary. Maintaining this balance
    was difficult, however, and it gave way over time\textemdash first to a preoccupation
    with market power during the post\textendash World War II period, and then to
    a fixation on consumer welfare in the late twentieth century. Refocusing policy

    Despite the antipathy they arouse, foreign and military policies. Despite the

    the greatest long-term contribution towards Britain''s rise to the status of a

pomeranzGreatDivergenceChina2009:
  abstract: '{The Great Divergencebrings new insight to one of the classic questions
    of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in Northwest Europe, despite
    surprising similarities between advanced areas of Europe and East Asia? As Ken
    Pomeranz shows, as recently as 1750, parallels between these two parts of the
    world were very high in life expectancy, consumption, product and factor markets,
    and the strategies of households. Perhaps most surprisingly, Pomeranz demonstrates
    that the Chinese and Japanese cores were no worse off ecologically than Western
    Europe. Core areas throughout the eighteenth-century Old World faced comparable
    local shortages of land-intensive products, shortages that were only partly resolved
    by trade. Pomeranz argues that Europe''s nineteenth-century divergence from the
    Old World owes much to the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for timber.
    This made Europe''s failure to use its land intensively much less of a problem,
    while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries. Another crucial difference
    that he notes has to do with trade. Fortuitous global conjunctures made the Americas
    a greater source of needed primary products for Europe than any Asian periphery.
    This allowed Northwest Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize further
    in manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased imports rather
    than maximizing yields. Together, coal and the New World allowed Europe to grow
    along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths. Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac.
    Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed after 1750, both in population and
    in manufacturing, this growth prevented these peripheral regions from exporting
    vital resources to the cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. As a result, growth in the
    core of East Asia''s economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was
    forced along labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have been
    forced down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks from underground
    and overseas.}'

vanzandenSmallBeautifulEfficiency2012:
  abstract: '{In this paper, we analyse the functioning of private capital markets
    in Holland in the late medieval period. We argue that in the absence of banks
    and state agencies involved in the supply of credit, entrepreneurs'' access to
    credit was determined by two interrelated factors. The first was the quality of
    property rights protection and the extent to which properties could be used as
    collateral. The second was the level of interest in borrowing money at the time
    as well as such borrowing compared with the interest rates on risk-free investments.
    For our case study, the small town of Edam and its hinterland, De Zeevang, in
    the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, we demonstrate that properties were used
    as collateral on a large scale and that interest rates on both small and large
    loans were relatively low (about 6 percent). As a result, many households (whether
    headed by men or women) owned financial assets and/or debts, and the degree of
    financial sophistication was relatively high.}'
